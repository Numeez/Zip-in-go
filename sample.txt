ZIP is an archive file format that supports lossless data compression. A ZIP file may contain one or more files or directories that may have been compressed. The ZIP file format permits a number of compression algorithms, though DEFLATE is the most common. This format was originally created in 1989 and was first implemented in PKWARE, Inc.'s PKZIP utility,[2] as a replacement for the previous ARC compression format by Thom Henderson. The ZIP format was then quickly supported by many software utilities other than PKZIP. Microsoft has included built-in ZIP support (under the name "compressed folders") in versions of Microsoft Windows since 1998 via the "Plus! 98" addon for Windows 98. Native support was added as of the year 2000 in Windows ME. [citation needed] Apple has included built-in ZIP support in Mac OS X 10.3 (via BOMArchiveHelper, now Archive Utility) and later. Most free operating systems have built in support for ZIP in similar manners to Windows and macOS.
ZIP files generally use the file extensions .zip or .ZIP and the MIME media type application/zip.[1] ZIP is used as a base file format by many programs, usually under a different name. When navigating a file system via a user interface, graphical icons representing ZIP files often appear as a document or other object prominently featuring a zipper.
History
The .ZIP file format was designed by Phil Katz of PKWARE and Gary Conway of Infinity Design Concepts. The format was created after Systems Enhancement Associates (SEA) filed a lawsuit against PKWARE claiming that the latter's archiving products, named PKARC, were derivatives of SEA's ARC archiving system.[3] The name "zip" (meaning "move at high speed") was suggested by Katz's friend, Robert Mahoney.[4] They wanted to imply that their product would be faster than ARC and other compression formats of the time.[4] The earliest known version of .ZIP File Format Specification was first published as part of PKZIP 0.9 package under the file APPNOTE.TXT in 1989.[citation needed] By distributing the zip file format within APPNOTE.TXT, compatibility with the zip file format proliferated widely on the public Internet during the 1990s.[5]
PKWARE and Infinity Design Concepts made a joint press release on February 14, 1989, releasing the .ZIP file format into the public domain.[6][7][8][9][10]
Version history
The .ZIP File Format Specification has its own version number, which does not necessarily correspond to the version numbers for the PKZIP tool, especially with PKZIP 6 or later. At various times, PKWARE has added preliminary features that allow PKZIP products to extract archives using advanced features, but PKZIP products that create such archives are not made available until the next major release. Other companies or organizations support the PKWARE specifications at their own pace.
The .ZIP file format specification is formally named "APPNOTE - .ZIP File Format Specification" and it is published on the PKWARE.com website since the late 1990s.[11] Several versions of the specification were not published. Specifications of some features such as BZIP2 compression, strong encryption specification and others were published by PKWARE a few years after their creation. The URL of the online specification was changed several times on the PKWARE website.
A summary of key advances in various versions of the PKWARE specification:
2.0: (1993)[1] File entries can be compressed with DEFLATE and use traditional PKWARE encryption (ZipCrypto).
2.1: (1996) Deflate64 compression
4.5: (2001)[12] Documented 64-bit zip format.
4.6: (2001) BZIP2 compression (not published online until the publication of APPNOTE 5.2)
5.0: (2002) SES: DES, Triple DES, RC2, RC4 supported for encryption (not published online until the publication of APPNOTE 5.2)
5.2: (2003)[13][14] AES encryption support for SES (defined in APPNOTE 5.1 that was not published online) and AES from WinZip ("AE-x"); corrected version of RC2-64 supported for SES encryption.
6.1: (2004)[15] Documented certificate storage.
6.2.0: (2004)[16] Documented Central Directory Encryption.
6.3.0: (2006)[17] Documented Unicode (UTF-8) filename storage. Expanded list of supported compression algorithms (LZMA, PPMd+), encryption algorithms (Blowfish, Twofish), and hashes.
6.3.1: (2007)[18] Corrected standard hash values for SHA-256/384/512.
6.3.2: (2007)[19] Documented compression method 97 (WavPack).
6.3.3: (2012)[20] Document formatting changes to facilitate referencing the PKWARE Application Note from other standards using methods such as the JTC 1 Referencing Explanatory Report (RER) as directed by JTC 1/SC 34 N 1621.
6.3.4: (2014)[21] Updates the PKWARE, Inc. office address.
6.3.5: (2018)[22] Documented compression methods 16, 96 and 99, DOS timestamp epoch and precision, added extra fields for keys and decryption, as well as typos and clarifications.
6.3.6: (2019)[23] Corrected typographical error.
6.3.7: (2020)[24] Added Zstandard compression method ID 20.
6.3.8: (2020)[25] Moved Zstandard compression method ID from 20 to 93, deprecating the former. Documented method IDs 94 and 95 (MP3 and XZ respectively).
6.3.9: (2020)[26] Corrected a typo in Data Stream Alignment description.
6.3.10: (2022)[27] Added several z/OS attribute values for APPENDIX B. Added several additional 3rd party Extra Field mappings.
WinZip, starting with version 12.1, uses the extension .zipx for ZIP files that use compression methods newer than DEFLATE; specifically, methods BZip, LZMA, PPMd, Jpeg and Wavpack. The last 2 are applied to appropriate file types when "Best method" compression is selected.[28][29]
Standardization
In April 2010, ISO/IEC JTC 1 initiated a ballot to determine whether a project should be initiated to create an ISO/IEC International Standard format compatible with ZIP.[30] The proposed project, entitled Document Packaging, envisaged a ZIP-compatible 'minimal compressed archive format' suitable for use with a number of existing standards including OpenDocument, Office Open XML and EPUB.
In 2015, ISO/IEC 21320-1 "Document Container File â€” Part 1: Core" was published which states that "Document container files are conforming Zip files". It requires the following main restrictions of the ZIP file format:[31]
Files in ZIP archives may only be stored uncompressed, or using the "deflate" compression (i.e. compression method may contain the value "0" - stored or "8" - deflated).
The encryption features are prohibited.
The digital signature features (from SES) are prohibited.
The "patched data" features (from PKPatchMaker) are prohibited.
Archives may not span multiple volumes or be segmented.
Design
.ZIP files are archives that store multiple files. ZIP allows contained files to be compressed using many different methods, as well as simply storing a file without compressing it. Each file is stored separately, allowing different files in the same archive to be compressed using different methods. Because the files in a ZIP archive are compressed individually, it is possible to extract them, or add new ones, without applying compression or decompression to the entire archive. This contrasts with the format of compressed tar files, for which such random-access processing is not easily possible.
A directory is placed at the end of a ZIP file. This identifies what files are in the ZIP and identifies where in the ZIP that file is located. This allows ZIP readers to load the list of files without reading the entire ZIP archive. ZIP archives can also include extra data that is not related to the ZIP archive. This allows for a ZIP archive to be made into a self-extracting archive (application that decompresses its contained data), by prepending the program code to a ZIP archive and marking the file as executable. Storing the catalog at the end also makes possible hiding a zipped file by appending it to an innocuous file, such as a GIF image file.
The .ZIP format uses a 32-bit CRC algorithm and includes two copies of each entry metadata to provide greater protection against data loss. The CRC-32 algorithm was contributed by David Schwaderer and can be found in his book "C Programmers Guide to NetBIOS" published by Howard W. Sams & Co. Inc.[32]
